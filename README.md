Hi there 👋
I am Sachit Ghimire and this is my Github. 

Through academic projects and hands-on experience, I have worked with technologies such as Python, Java, machine learning models, computer networks, and security concepts, 
and I am continuously expanding my skill set by building and experimenting with new systems. I am particularly interested in understanding how intelligent and secure systems 
are designed, optimized, and applied in real environments.
